1. Download X-code from App store
2. Install the X-code, run in terminal "xcode-select --install"
3. Install Carthage (dependency manager for macOS & IOS), run in terminal "brew install carthage"
Note: If you don't have homebrew then install homebrew from terminal
 run in terminal: "/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
4. IOS capabilities configuration in wdio.conf.js and Appium inspector
capabilities: [{
      "platformName": "IOS",
      "appium:deviceName": "iPhone 14 Pro Max",
      "appium:platformVersion": "16.0",
      "appium:automationName": "XCUItest",
      "appium:app": iosAppPath,
    }],

5. Install 2 IOS virtual devices for Xcode, 1 for Manual and 1 for local automation
   *Go to ->  X-Code >Windows > Devices & Simulator> Simulators
6. Start the session Appium inspector with IOS simulator capabilities (for ANDROID first we need to turn on the emulator/device than start session in Appium inspector,
 but for IOS we just directly start session in Appium Inspector, it will automatically turn ON the required simulator attached to Xcode)
